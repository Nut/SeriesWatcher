  <Overview>Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie who was brought to life by the necromancer, Eucliwood Hellscythe, after being killed by an unknown assailant. A month since then, Eucliwood has been living with Ayumu as he continues to search for his killer. Whilst searching a graveyard, Ayumu encounters a chainsaw wielding 'masō-shōjo' named Haruna fighting a giant demon bear, cutting through him to defeat it. Haruna attempts to erase Ayumu's memories afterwards but his zombie nature ends up cancelling out her magic. Haruna decides to stay at Ayumu's house until the matter is resolved. The next day, Ayumu is approached by a crayfish like demon known as a Megalo. Haruna arrives but is unable to summon her magic, so Ayumu uses his zombie strength to pummel the Megalo. He then uses Ayumu's magic to transform into a masō-shōjo and finish him off. After landing and facing humiliation from his classmates, Ayumu is informed by Haruna that he is to become a masō shōjo in her place. </Overview>

  <Overview>A week after the Megalo attack, Ayumu's dinnertime is suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a vampire ninja named Seraphim who requests the assistance of Eucliwood. Wanting to replace Ayumu's role as Eucliwood's servant, Seraphim challenges him to a fight which Ayumu just barely manages to win. Seraphim decides instead to become Ayumu's servant and live with him so she can be close to Eucliwood. Ayumu recalls the night when he first met Eucliwood. Later that night, Ayumu came across a house being attacked by a serial killer, and was stabbed by a sword in the process, before Eucliwood revived him as a zombie. The next day when Haruna gets into an argument with Ayumu and tells him to die, Eucliwood slaps her, saying death isn't to be taken lightly, so Haruna apologises to her. </Overview>

  <Overview>Whilst wondering if he should suspect Eucliwood, Ayumu is attacked by a Doberman Megalo named Kerberos Wansard, though he stops when he recognises Eucliwood. As he takes his leave, he mentions taking the soul of someone being killed, so Ayumu decides to follow him. Kerberos mentions to Ayumu about how Eucliwood takes on people's pain when she heals them. After arriving at the crime scene, where the soul had already been sacrificed, they are both stabbed and Kerberos is killed, with Ayumu unable to make out the killer's face. Upon returning home, Ayumu talks with Eucliwood, who explains that in order to keep her magic under control, she can't express emotions or speak any words. Eucliwood cries, wondering if Ayumu hates her now that he knows this, but he insists that he will stay by her side. The next day, the city is attacked by a giant Whale Megalo, which Seraphim and Ayumu in masō-shōjo form fight against. After Seraphim cuts it, Ayumu utilises 1000% of the masō-shōjo form's power to kick its head off. Meanwhile at the hospital, Kyōko is seen dead with her throat slitted. </Overview>

  <Overview>In order to stay alive, Seraphim drinks a little blood from Haruna, kissing her as an anesthetic. As the girls takes a bath, Ayumu takes a call from Haruna's teacher, Dai-sensei, who tells her she originally planned to send Haruna to Kyoto to get some tofu, but she ended up in Tokyo instead. Ayumu then gets a call from Kyoko, who agrees to meet up with him to help get some Kyoto tofu. As the two meet up at the graveyard, Kyoko suddenly stabs Ayumu, revealing herself as both the serial killer and a masō-shōjo. She tries to kill Ayumu, but Haruna and Seraphim arrive to back him up, though Kyoko still has the advantage using powers similar to a Megalo's. As Ayumu transforms and joins Seraphim in fighting her, Kyoko reveals she decided to start harvesting souls in order to become immortal. Ayumu manages to grab hold of Kyoko while Seraphim stabs through him to get to her. However, she manages to survive and wounds Seraphim, forcing Eucliwood to step in. </Overview>

  <Overview>Eucliwood negates all of Kyoko's attacks and manages to transform herself into a masō-shōjo, which brings Ayumu to the conclusion that it was her who had absorbed Haruna's magic to the strength of her own. Taking the fight elsewhere, Eucliwood uses the power of her words to kill Kyoko over and over. However, Kyoko manages to stop this by tearing her eardrums and attacks Eucliwood with a powerful explosion which knocks her unconscious. Resolved to protect Eucliwood, Ayumu manages to get up close and negate Kyoko's magic, before killing her down to her last life, which he decides to spare. Dai-sensei appears to take Kyoko home to reeducate her, when another evil presence possesses Kyoko and escapes with her. Eucliwood mentions the presence was that of a zombie that she was forced to kill when it was consumed by malice. </Overview>

  <Overview>Eucliwood is confronted by the zombie who she thought she had killed. Meanwhile, Seraphim reveals that she had received orders to kill Eucliwood since her clan believed her magic was attracting Megalos, but Ayumu manages to convince her to abandon that mission. The zombie's threats to harm her friends causes Eucliwood's emotions to waver, summoning a large kappa doll which lands on top of Haruna and starts crushing her. Dai-sensei arrives and knocks the kappa off of Haruna, only for it to land on Yuki instead, who then becomes possessed and summons a weapon named Mysticore which goes out of control. Mysticore prepares to self-destruct, but Ayumu manages to embrace Yuki and stop it from happening. As the zombie takes his leave, Eucliwood becomes afraid she may hurt her friends and decides to leave, leaving behind a note for Ayumu. </Overview>

  <Overview>The girls manage to find all the pieces to put Ayumu back together, but he doesn't wake up. Dai-sensei appears and sends Haruna's mind into Ayumu's self-consciousness, where he is blaming himself for being too weak. Haruna manages to knock some sense into him, allowing him to wake up. Later, Ayumu and Haruna appear before Yoruno and Eucliwood, whilst Seraphim, who had drank Eucliwood's blood, stands against the gateway to the demon world, using the violin to play a soothing song to fight off the hordes of Megalo coming through before the other vampire ninjas back her up. As Ayumu struggles against Yoruno, Mystletainn reacts and convince both Ayumu and Haruna to transform into Masō-Shōjos, allowing them to overcome Yoruno's mist, though Haruna gets separated from Ayumu in the process. Ayumu then proceeds to beat Yoruno up for not understanding Eucliwood's feelings. Yoruno comes to understand Ayumu and Eucliwood finally agrees to let him die. Afterward, Ayumu begs Eucliwood not to leave again, to which she finally responds with her own voice that she'll stay with him no matter what. </Overview>

  <Overview>Ayumu, Haruna, Eucliwood and Seraphim go to an indoor swimming pool where they also run into Yuki, Taeko and Kanami. Seraphim is shocked to find her fellow vampire ninja, Sarasvati, performing as a net idol. She somehow finds herself in a popularity contest against her, which Haruna decides to enter as well. Dai-sensei brings out a device that allows Eucliwood to swap her magical ability with Ayumu, allowing her to sing as well. The machine breaks down mid-performance, but Haruna uses some of her magic to let Eucliwood keep singing. However, Ayumu still with Eucliwood's magic, speaks his mind and puts all the girls in skimpy bikinis, leading to a swift punishment. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Dai-sensei reports to Ayumu that Mystletainn will soon return home good as new, preparations begin for the school festival, with Haruna contributing her egg-cooking knowledge and Ayumu's class deciding to do a haunted café. On the day before the festival, Ayumu encounters a curious man who gives him a ring. After Ayumu spends the evening working on preparations with Taeko, he returns home to find that Mystletainnn has returned and uses it to remove everyone's memories of that unfortunate incident. However, to his misfortune, his classmates force him to crossdress anyway to advertise the café. Yuki asks Ayumu to accompany her in accordance to a letter she received, only to get hit by a prank and ends up summoning Mysticore again. The man from before appears, telling Ayumu to put the ring he received onto Yuki, which surpresses Mysticore so Yuki won't become a weapon anymore, although she mistakes it for a wedding ring when she wakes up. Just then, some Megalos appear in the culture festival, so Haruna, using a device to absorb some of Eucliwood's mana, transforms into a Masō-Shōjo alongside Ayumu in order to defeat them. Afterwards however, Haruna starts to experience an intense headache. </Overview>

  <Overview>As a result of absorbing Eucliwood's mana, Haruna now experiences the same pains Eucliwood usually faces when speaking and being expressive. As the second day of the festival goes underway, Haruna throws her mana-absorption device away while Yuki has her ring confiscated by the teacher. At the end of the festival, the same teacher reveals himself to be the fairy Ayumu had met, a Masō-Shōjo named Chris who was Dai-sensei's mentor, who had used Haruna's device to absorb enough mana to undo a curse placed upon her. After launching the entire class into the sky, she manages to beat Ayumu before escaping with everyone's mana. As Dai-sensei gets word of Chris' revival, Kyoko offers to make a deal with her. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Dai-sensei takes over as teacher for Ayumu's class, she decides to put Ayumu through a trial, threatening to erase his memories should he fail. A class taught by Haruna soon comes under chaos when she accidentally creates a giant slime. Judging Ayumu's ability to handle the situation as a failure, Dai-sensei takes away Ayumu's memories. As Haruna, Eucliwood and Sera express their desire to bring Ayumu's memories back, Dai-sensei gives them the opportunity to dive into his consciousness and recover his memories. Finding a remnant of Ayumu's memories, the girls soon come across representations of Ayumu's various emotions, but easily beat them. They soon come across the representation of Ayumu's sloth, Belphegor, who takes over Ayumu's body. As Eucliwood confronts Ayumu in her Masō-Shōjo mode, she shows her all the notes she had written for him and, working with Haruna, manages to bring back his memories. At the end of the episode, a new girl holding a talking doll (whose name is not yet revealed) is shown to have an interest in Ayumu, foreshadowing things to come. The episode then concludes after showing short scenes of Naegleria and Chris, Saras and Yuki, and the Aikawa household. </Overview>
